                        creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays

                    <p>My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical student
                        working for an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning.
                        The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet
                        Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all the more
                        striking for its brevity.</p>

                    <p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a
                        quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they
                        seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed,
                        seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth's
                        gravitational energy." On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.</p>
